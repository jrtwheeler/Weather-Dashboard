  ## Description
  The weather dashboard generates the daily and five day forecast for a user-entered city. The dashboard keeps a search history of the cities entered. Saved searches are    buttons that return the daily and five day forecast. The list can be cleared using the clear button. 
  ## [Deployment](https://jrtwheeler.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/)
  ## Usage
To return a five day forecast, enter a city in the search bar and then click the search button. The forecast includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index, and a graphic for the weather. The app saves the cities entered in the search form.
