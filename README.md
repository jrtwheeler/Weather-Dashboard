  ## Description
  The weather dashboard generates the daily and five day forecast for a user-entered city. The dashboard keeps a search history of the cities entered. Saved searches are buttons that return the daily and five day forecast. The list can be cleared using the clear button. The page can be found on GitHub at [Weather Dashboard](https://jrtwheeler.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/).
